# Changes for PHP Mode by Version

All notable changes of the PHP Mode 1.19.1 release series are documented in this file using the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) principles.

## [1.21.4] - 2019-05-29

This version contains unobtrusive changes for future compatibility. Also, `forward-page` /` backward-page` may improve your operation. Thank you [@takeokunn].

### Added

 * A new command `php-mode-maybe` has been added to improve the compatibility of Blade templates and HTML templates with Web Mode. ([#532])
 * A new custom variable php-mode-page-delimiter is added, which is assigned to page-delimiter in PHP-Mode. It allows you to move smoothly to the previous and subsequent definition statements with `forward-page` (<kbd>C-x C-[</kbd>) and `backward-page` (<kbd>C-x C-]</kbd>). ([#540] by [@takeokunn])

### Change

 * `php-maybe-mode` and `.php` files are associated with `auto-mode-alist` instead of `php-mode` ([#532])
 * Compatibility with [poly-php] has been improved. This has not yet been officially released.

### Deprecated

 * PHP Mode does not support phpt files . Consider installing the [phpt-mode] package. This mode is a wrapper around Polymode based PHP-Mode.
